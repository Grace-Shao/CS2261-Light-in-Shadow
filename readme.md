## What is finished about the game so far
- The flashlight functionality (had to do some big brain thinking here)
- enemies randomly choose a part of the screen to lurk out, will randomly attack player (25% chance of attacking)
- player can collect keys
- every 5 clicks of the flashlight decreases the flashlight ui bar until u run out
- flashlight follows player
- when flashlight collides with enemy, it "freezes the enemy"
- going through a door leads you to the next lvl
- enemy eyes show even in the darkness and flickers (how cool is that!!)

## What still needs to be added
- keys can unlock doors
- better level design
- bg needs to be updated

## Any bugs you have found
- lose screen needs to be centered after dying
- tile modefication
- probably more

## For our sake, how to play/navigate the game in its current state (and see anything you want us to see)
- the title screen is blank, and click start to transition between start, instructions, pause/unpause, lose/win, back to start
- Button B is walk left, button A is walk right
- WASD is which direction to point the light at, point at an enemy to freeze and kill them
- Try to pick up keys and go through doors
